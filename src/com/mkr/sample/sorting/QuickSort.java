/**
 * Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given
 * array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.
 *
 * 1. Always pick first element as pivot.
 * 2. Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below)
 * 3. Pick a random element as pivot.
 * 4. Pick median as pivot.
 *
 * The key process in quickSort is partition().
 *
 * Important :
 *  Merge sort is efficient than quick sort, but if space is a constraint then use quick sort. Since merge sort
 *  creates temporary arrays while merging.
 *
 *  "Quick Sort in its general form is an in-place sort (i.e. it doesnâ€™t require any extra storage) whereas merge sort
 *   requires O(N) extra storage, N denoting the array size which may be quite expensive.
 *   Allocating and de-allocating the extra space used for merge sort increases the running time of the algorithm."
 *
 *  So, Quick Sort is preferred over MergeSort for sorting Arrays.
 *  MergeSort is preferred over QuickSort for Linked Lists.
 *
 *  "Merge sort is more efficient and works faster than quick sort in case of larger array size or datasets.
 *   whereas Quick sort is more efficient and works faster than merge sort in case of smaller array size or datasets"
 *
 * Worst case : O(n2)
 * Avg case : O(n * log(n))
